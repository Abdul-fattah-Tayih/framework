# Vanilo
## The Truly Laravel E-commerce Framework

Vanilo's aim is that we (Laravel developers) can **rapidly** create E-commerce applications with **pleasure**.

Vanilo is in an early development stage. It's expected to have the first working version in September 2017.

Feel free to submit your questions, suggestions by adding a [new issue](https://github.com/artkonekt/vanilo/issues/new) here.

See the foundations of Vanilo, that have already been settled:

- Concord: Laravel Extension for building modular applications. See [repo](https://github.com/artkonekt/concord) and [documentation](artkonekt.github.io/concord).
- AppShell: Admin, [users](https://github.com/artkonekt/user) (Laravel's default slightly extended), [acl](https://github.com/artkonekt/acl), [menus](https://github.com/artkonekt/menu), [clients](https://github.com/artkonekt/client), [addressing](https://github.com/artkonekt/address)
